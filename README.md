## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

3D Data Processing has gained significant traction in various fields, notably geospatial mapping and digital twins. This repository serves as a course and code learning hub for understanding and implementing 3D data processing techniques using Python and Open-Source Tools.

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

Before diving into the tutorials, make sure you have the necessary tools and libraries installed. Please refer to the [Installation](#installation) section for detailed instructions.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To get started with 3D Data Processing, you'll need to set up your environment. Each code package is grounded with a how-to guide accessible on this [Medium Page](https://medium.com/@florentpoux). You then have a section dedicated to the local setup.
It usually involves this:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/3d-deep-learning.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd 3d-data-processing

# Install miniconda with Python version 3.10

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
conda create -n DEEPTUTO python=3.10

# Activate the virtual environment
conda activate

# Install dependencies using requirements (if set-up)
pip install -r requirements.txt

#Install dependencies using the given libraries in the Medium Article
pip install numpy matplotlib rasterio laspy open3d
```
